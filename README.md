# Student Sleep & Happiness Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes student lifestyle data to explore the relationship between sleep patterns, daily routines, and overall happiness levels. The objective was to identify behavioral trends and statistically evaluate factors influencing student well-being.

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains structured student-level records including:
- Sleep duration
- Study hours
- Screen time
- Physical activity
- Happiness score
- Other daily routine metrics

Total observations: 39,000+ records

---

## Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Identify correlations between sleep and happiness
- Test hypotheses using statistical methods
- Visualize behavioral patterns using Python

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Statistical Analysis

---

## Key Insights
- Sleep duration shows measurable correlation with happiness levels.
- Students with balanced routines demonstrate higher well-being scores.
- Excessive screen time negatively impacts reported happiness.
- Statistical testing supports the significance of lifestyle factors.
